# 🌍 International Debt Analysis

![Debt Analysis](image.jpg)

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we dive into **international debt data** collected by **The World Bank**, which tracks how developing countries manage debt to finance infrastructure and essential services. Debt is a powerful tool that helps nations invest in growth, but it needs to be monitored and analyzed for transparency and sustainability.

This dataset provides insights into the **amount of debt (in USD)** owed by developing countries across various financial indicators. We'll use **SQL** to explore and extract key insights from the dataset.

## 🧠 Key Questions

1. **How many distinct countries are present in the database?**
2. **Which country has the highest total debt?**
3. **Which country has the lowest amount of repayments?**

## 🗃️ Dataset Structure

You'll be working with a table named `international_debt`, which has the following columns:

| Column | Definition | Data Type |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| `country_name` | Name of the country | `varchar` |
| `country_code` | Code representing the country | `varchar` |
| `indicator_name` | Description of the debt indicator | `varchar` |
| `indicator_code` | Code representing the debt indicator | `varchar` |
| `debt` | Value of the debt indicator for the given country (in current US dollars) | `float` |

## 📈 Outcome

This project helps understand how to use SQL for data analysis and extract meaningful insights from real-world financial data. You’ll get hands-on experience working with:
- Aggregations
- Filtering with `WHERE`
- Sorting with `ORDER BY`
- Grouping with `GROUP BY`
